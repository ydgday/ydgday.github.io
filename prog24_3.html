<br>12:00 Ian McIntosh (York) <i>The (geometric) Toda equations for noncompact symmetric spaces over compact Riemann surfaces</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
The Toda equations arise in many different geometric settings and for those of us who keep running into them
it is often difficult to establish which version comes from where. The aim of this talk is to characterise one source: those
which come from primitive harmonic maps into noncompact symmetric spaces. This is essentially an exercise in Lie algebra theory.
I will also talk about when one can apply well-established existence methods (from abelian gauge theory) to equations of this type.
These methods only apply to a minority of the versions of Toda available. None of the methods used are new: the purpose of the
exercise is to provide a useful classification. For all of these equations there are Higgs bundles lurking about. I will hopefully have time to
explain how they fit in as well.

<strong>Travel:</strong></font>
<br>

<br> Leeds is easily accessible by train and has direct inter-city links with major destinations in the UK. In particular, if you are travelling from London, there is a direct high-speed train from King's Cross railway station with average journey time of 140 minutes.<br>

<br>From the railway station, the University campus is within walking distance of approximately 15-20 minutes.<br>

<br>
The Google map of the university campus can be found

<strong>History and organizers:</strong></font>
<br>

<br>Yorkshire and Durham Geometry Days are jointly organised by the Universities of Durham, Leeds and York, and occur at a frequency of three meetings per academic year.
 <!--Financial support is provided by the London Mathematical Society through a Scheme 3 grant, currently administered by the University of York.-->

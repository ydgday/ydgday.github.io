<br>11.00 Coffee and Reception<br>

<br>11.30 Eirik Eike Svanes (Jussieu) 
<br><i>Moduli of Heterotic Geometries.</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
I will review some recent developments of certain SU(3) and G2 structure
geometries with bundles, referred to as heterotic compactifications in the
string theory community. After a brief overview of the infinitesimal
moduli of heterotic SU(3) geometries, I turn to the corresponding seven
dimensional story. There are many similarities between the two situations,
but also crucial differences that I will expand upon. Finally, I will
report on some recent progress in understanding the finite deformations in
six dimensions. We will see that the Maurer-Cartan equation of the
corresponding differentially graded Lie algebra can be understood as the
equation of motion of an effective theory derived from a holomorphic
functional on the moduli space, known as the heterotic superpotential.
This effective theory has features which combine and generalise aspects of
both Holomorphic Chern-Simons and Kodaira-Spencer theory.

<br>12.30 Lunch<br>

<br>13.30 Marcos Jardim (UNICAMP) 
<br><i>Instanton sheaves and complex instantons.</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
Instanton bundles were introduced by Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin
and Manin in the late 1970s as the holomorphic counterparts, via twistor
theory, to anti-self-dual SU(r) connections (a.k.a. instantons) on the
sphere S^4. We will revise the ADHM construction of instanton sheaves on
CP^3, along with some recent results regarding the basic geometrical features of their moduli spaces. Finally, we outline the construction of the corresponding SL(r,C) instanton connections of R^4.

<br>14.30 Marie-Amelie Lawn (Imperial)
<br><i>A spinorial representation of submanifolds in space forms.</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
We give a spinorial representation of submanifolds of any dimension and codimension into Riemannian space forms in terms of the existence of particular spinors. As an application we will give a new concise proof of the fundamental theorem of submanifold theory. 
</font><br>

<br>15.30 Tea Break<br>

<br>16.00 Mark Gross (Cambridge) 
<br><i>A general mirror symmetry construction.</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
Mirror symmetry was first discovered by string theorists circa 1990 as a duality between two very different Calabi-Yau manifolds. Since then, there have been many constructions of mirror pairs which apply to specific families of Calabi-Yau manifolds, but no construction which works in all cases. I will outline a recently announced construction due to myself and Siebert which produces mirrors in all cases that mirrors are expected to exist.

<strong>Travel:</strong></font>
<br>

<br> Leeds is easily accessible by train and has direct inter-city links with major destinations in the UK. In particular, if you are travelling from London, there is a direct high-speed train from King's Cross railway station with average journey time of 140 minutes.<br>

<br>From the railway station, the University campus is within walking distance of approximately 15-20 minutes.<br>

<br>
The Google map of the university campus can be found

<strong>History and organizers:</strong></font>
<br>

<br>Yorkshire and Durham Geometry Days are jointly organised by the Universities of Durham, Leeds and York, and occur at a frequency of three meetings per academic year. Financial support is provided by the London Mathematical Society through a Scheme 3 grant, currently administered by the University of York. 

<p>The current local organizers are:</font></p>
